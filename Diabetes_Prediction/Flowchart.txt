1. Importing Dependencies
2. Data Collection(pandas)
3. Data separation(X&Y)
4. Data Standardization(Converting data to smaller closeby values)
5. Splitting data(train and test)
6. Training the model(SVM = Support Vector Machine)
7. Evaluating the accuracy of both test and train
8. Finally making a predictive model(using one instance)
