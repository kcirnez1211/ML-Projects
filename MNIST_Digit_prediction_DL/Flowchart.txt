1. Importing various libraries for NN such as TensorFlow, cv2, and PIL
2. Loading the preprocessed MNIST data in train and test data
3. scaling the NumPy arrays by dividing by 225
4. Building layers for NN
5. Compiling the model
6. Evaluating the loss and accuracy
7. Converting predictions to integral labels(using np.argmax())
8. Creating confusion matrix and heat maps
9. Building a predictive system:
	# taking input as an image file
	# converting it to grayscale from RGB
	# Resizing it(28,28)
	# Reshaping it for input
	# Predicting and convering the label
